# My Neovim configuration for Clojure(Script) development
Steal anything you like and send me a message `@fatihict` on the [Clojurians Slack](http://clojurians.net/) if I can improve upon something :D

## To fix
- [ ] Ctags shouldn't see metadata as a function name
- [ ] Check-in ~/.lein/profiles
- [ ] Check-in ~/.ctags
- [ ] Improve this README with a table of functions I need to use/remember
- [ ] Check-in clojure snippets
